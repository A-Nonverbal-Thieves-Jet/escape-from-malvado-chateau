## Project Objectives: User Stories

#### Puzzle engine

As a user, I would like to find hidden clues and solve puzzles, in order to have an engaging experience. 

- Build a grid in the user interface.
- Create puzzles and clues via on-screen events. 
- Write and implement text that appears to add narrative detail.

- Ensure that grid is tailored to each room for precision
- Test event listeners and ensure they interact with items
- Check text display and make sure that it works in the display box

####	Audio Controls

As a user, I want audio controls so that I can control whether I have to hear the game sounds play

- Implement a mute button
- Connect the button to an event listener that controls the audio
- Give the button a visual cue that indicates the status

- Check the formatting and filepaths. 
- Make sure that the mute/unmute both work 
- Check the display for each page. 

####	Inventory Display	

As a user, I want a clear inventory display so that I can keep track of the items I have collected.

- On page load, check localStorage for inventory data and display collected items.
- When an item is collected, add it to the inventory display and the localStorage inventory.
- Connect interactable elements in the user interface to inventory status. 

- Confirm data is saving to localStorage and loading. 
- Check filepaths and ensure items are displaying properly on all pages. 
- Store object data and compare with interactables via Javascript

####	Project Documentation

As a fellow software developer, I want a link to the GitHub repository with a clear README that outlines the details of the project. 

- Write clear user stories so that the README clearly outlines the core goals of the project. 
- Add wireframe images that convey the intent of each page design.
- Keep a solid commit history with commit messages that detail why changes were made. 

- Proofread the README and make edits for clarity. 
- Ensure wireframes are complete, up to date, and implemented to the README correctly.
- Inspect commit messages during merge reviews and follow up on contents. 

####	Hints
As a user, I would like access to hints so that I can get help if I am stuck in the game. 

- Define text hints for each interactable on each room page. 
- Create a hint button that displays the list of hints on each room.
- Check that the correct hints are displaying on each room and that the formatting is clear. 

- Proofread all hint copy, check for style and clarity. 
- Ensure that hint button properly hides and displays hint content and is visible on the page. 
- Test hint button for each room and inspect deployed layout.
